Hello! Iâ€™m Shiv, an undergraduate studying [Computer Science](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/teaching) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). Over the summer, I interned at [Amazon's Alexa team](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/business_categories/alexa) in Cambridge, UK.

Having done well in a number of hackathons, it's no secret that I really enjoy solving old problems by inventing new things and am deeply passionate about delivering a great experience to whoever's using what I've built. Naturally, I'm keen on being a Software Engineer.

Here are a few technologies I've worked with. I am particularly skilled in Java and Python, and pick up new languages quite quickly.
