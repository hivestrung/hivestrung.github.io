I worked on Alexa in the Answer Generation Team as part of a 12-week summer internship

- Worked in [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/) to implement a strong type system for a domain-specific language used for generating natural language
- Proposed backwards-compatible syntax change and implemented it by updating parser and lexer rules, internal data structures used for representing the language, and the parser used to populate these representations
- Implemented compiler validations for type checking in Java, making extensive use of [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava), [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice), [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) and [JUnit tests](https://junit.org/junit5/)
