Onboard Buddy is a comprehensive smart flashcard tool for incoming Amazon interns. Comes preloaded with a set of flashcards for [Amazon Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) and the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) Foundations Course.

Our flashcard algorithm, based on the [Supermemo algorithm](https://www.supermemo.com/en), automatically schedules flashcards to maximise retention. Besides questions and answers, it supports hints and explanations, and querying specific flashcards all by talking to Alexa.

_Please note, unfortunately the code on GitHub can't be made public because it was for an internal hackathon. I would, however, be happy to share more about what I learnt in general about building an Alexa Skill._
